# COVID-19 SMALL DATASET

I have taken a small dataset of Covid-19, just for understanding purpose. I have to work on the original dataset which contains 19000 rows.

The data used here is till 29-April-2020 and has records as on 29-April-2020.

The data is available as a CSV file, downloaded from kaggle.

I will analyze this data using the Pandas DataFrame.
